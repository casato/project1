HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM

-This program reads 1 file and creates 2 files.

The input file must be named "input.ubi"

The output file will be named "output.ubo"

The log file will be named "{date+time}_dispatchlog.xml"

--By default this program runs 5 random trip **REQUESTS** some trips may not be completed 
--due to driver unavailability or insufficient funds. These are noted in the log file.

I also included a cleanup script to remove any old log and output files that are no longer needed.
To use the cleanup utility:
-Open a terminal window in the root directory of this project (where all the log files are)
-type the following command: ./clean.sh
-All old logs and output files are now deleted.


How this is expandable to UberEats:
-Because UberEats is very similar to the Uber service, expanding to add this functionality should not be difficult.
-I can create an EatsTrip class that extends Trip and includes a Restaurant name and order.
-The payment system can remain the same.
-I can create an EatsDriver class that will extend the Driver class and can calculate the total cost including the food and mileage.
-I can reuse the transaction system and Dispatch.
